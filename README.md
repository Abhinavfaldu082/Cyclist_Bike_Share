ðŸš² Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study
Data Analysis & Visualization Project
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is part of a data analysis case study for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company. The goal is to analyze how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently and provide recommendations to increase membership conversions.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The data was sourced from Divvy Bike-Share (Q1 2019 & Q1 2020).
It includes trip details: ride length, start & end stations, user type (member/casual), and timestamps.
The dataset was cleaned & processed using R programming.
ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
âœ” R Programming â€“ Data wrangling & transformation (dplyr, ggplot2)
âœ” SQL â€“ Data filtering & aggregation
âœ” Tableau â€“ Data visualization & dashboards
âœ” Google Sheets â€“ Pivot tables & initial analysis

ðŸ“Š Key Insights & Findings
ðŸ”¹ Casual riders take longer trips than annual members but ride less frequently.
ðŸ”¹ Weekends see a high number of casual riders, while members ride more on weekdays.
ðŸ”¹ Casual riders prefer afternoon rides, whereas members ride during commuting hours.
